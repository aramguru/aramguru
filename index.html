                            <p>ARAM is a special mode in Heroes of the Storm where two teams of 5 players are given 3 randomly drafted heroes to choose from to fight for victory on a single lane.</p>

                            <p>Some people take this mode as a fun side gig to lose an hour in, others like myself take it a bit more seriously and play it almost excuselvly. Be mindful of that when setting your expectations.</p>

                                Why these facts matter? Sometimes you might want to do a globe quest, there are good and bad maps for that, or maybe you decide to pick a bribe talent (why?), or maybe you have a hero that needs space to chaise their target, or maybe you play <he>dehaka</he> and you have your <ab>dehaka,6</ab> disabled because there's no fog. These are all examples of decisions you'll have to make on a map-to-map basis.

                    <div class="content">
                        <div class="about">

                            <p>Each player is given a choise of 3 randomly drafted heroes. You have 30 seconds to create a strong setup with your team that idially includes heroes which compliment eachother.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Always pre-pick a hero so your teammates know your intentions, you can always switch if needed, but don't wait until the last second to switch to a healer, because the only other person who has healer has marked Valla. Then with a split second to the start you both switch to a healer and now your team has no damage dealers. Communicate.</li>
                                    <li>Fill your role. If you have the only role on your team the hero portrait will light up in yellow. That means you're the only one who has that role so make sure you pick that hero or you'll leave your team crippled. The only exception to that rule is if you have the only healer and someone else on your team has a support hero (<he>zarya</he> or <he>medivh</he>), then your portrait wont light up so you need to be aware.</li>
                                    <li>Pick a healer! The starting area does not heal heroes in ARAM so don't leave your team without a healer, these are the easiest games to lose.</li>
                                    <li>Synergyse with your teammates. If your team picks heroes with skillshots, avoid picking heroes that push/pull your enemy, instead consider a hero with some kind of CC. If you have the only 2 healer options, consider whether your team will stay mostly stacked or separated, see which healer will work better in which situation and pick that. You get the drill.</li>
                                    <li>Last but not least - don't troll. Don't pick F tier heroes just because you feel like dying 15 times with <he>thebutcher</he> and 0 meat. There are other game modes where you can do that, be respectful - don't waste your teammates' time.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <p>The hero role draft is mirrored between teams and between each player from both teams. In other words, if one player on your team has 3 tank picks for example, then there will be a player on the enemy team that has the same role picks as well. This information gives you a great insight on what is the possible setup of your enemy so you can plan your pick accordingly.</p>

                            <p>Games are won by doing damage to the enemy team, minions and structures, don't be surprised if you can't do that when your team picks 3 tanks.</p>

                            <p><b>No healer matches</b></p>
                            <p>Sometimes there will be no healer options to pick from, in this rare occurances some heroes (especially some marked with as F tier in this guide) become much, much stronger than they normally are. Pick heroes with self-sustain abilities and talents, pick heroes that can heal or shield allies. These type of games are usually an endurance rounds.</p>

                            <div class="divider"></div>

                            <p><b>Multuple healer matches</b></p>
                            <p>There will be times when you can see that there are 3, 4 or even 5 people on your team with healer picks. This means that there's a high chance that the enemy team picks quite a few if not all 5. In this case consider a hero that has a skill or a talent that can reduce enemy healing such as <he>ana</he>, <he>xul</he>, <he>deckard</he>, otherwise they will be very annoying to kill.</p>

                            <div class="divider"></div>

                            <p><b>Mirrored matches</b></p>
                            <p>There's a 2% chanse that both teams will be given the same hero. The strategy of winning these kind of games is very different from anything covered in the guides bellow. In general, you have to know what are the strenghts and weaknesses of that hero are and exploit them as much as you can.</p>

                            <div class="divider"></div>

                            <p>A lot of games are won on draft before any fighting has been done, don't underestimate it.</p>

                            <p>Much like any other HOTS match there are roles in ARAM and are as important as in Quick Match or Storm League though the playstyle might differ a bit, since there's no soaking or capturing objectives like in a normal game.</p>

                            <p>Also, this information is a general rule of thumb, not something that you should follow religiously. Some bruisers can be tanks, some tanks can be assassins, some assassins can be useless, but that knowledge comes with experience.</p>

                            <p>There are numerous little things that might seem unimportant at first, but when stacked on top of eachother they can make you a much better player.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Learn the basics of most heroes before attempting to play ARAM. You will not perform adequetly if you don't know what you're doing. This is what Try Mode, vs AI and QM is for, to practise specific heroes, ARAM is not the right place for that and your teammates will be sure to tell you that.</li>
                                <li>Do your quests early even if that means you have to play risky, and maybe die a few times. Don't wait until mid-to-late game to unlock your hero's full potential.</li>
                                <li>Follow your teammates in battles - even if a situation doesn't look promising, sometimes a single input from you can make all the difference.</li>
                                <li>Learn to sidestep - this type of skillshot avoidance is even more important here, because of how often you need to perform it.</li>
                                <li>If you know you're playing against a full party (5 stack) - don't tell your teammates. Usually that demoralizes them and they underperform.</li>
                                <li>On the subject of that, don't give up if you know you're facing a stronger oponent. More often than not they'll be confused if you're not scared of them and they'll start playing badly. Use this to your advantage.</li>
                                <li>The more nervous you are the worst you'll perform. Take a breather between games to calm down if needed.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>If the enemy team has a nasty spell caster (or you don't care about tossing your teammates around like sacks of potatoes) that you can reach easily like <he>mephisto</he> at level 7 consider swapping <ta>garrosh,7,3</ta> for <ta>garrosh,7,2</ta>. Synergyzing it with your <ta>garrosh,20,2</ta> this will make sure this hero does almost no damage in team fights.</li>
                                <li>If the enemy team has some annoying assassins like <he>zeratul</he> or <he>genji</he> and your team doesn't have a good way of dealing with them, aaand there are no other sources of high damage that you need to mitigate, then maybe, just maybe consider taking <ta>garrosh,10,1</ta> instead of <ta>garrosh,10,2</ta>. Then at 20 take whatever, <ta>garrosh,20,3</ta> is fun, take that.</li>

                                This is the best and only Hogger build you should play in ARAM. It's insanly good and Secret Stash at level 20 is broken, allowing you to tank the enemy team for up to 20 seconds on a 60 seconds cooldown!
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dont use Hogg Wild to do damage, use it strategically to place yourself in advantageous position or for escape.</li>
                                    <li>If there are mostly ranged heroes on the enemy team switch Brute Force at level 4 for Hogger's Joggers.</li>
                                    <li>After taking Dense Blasting Powder, use Dynamite/Blow combo on cooldown to stack you level 1 quest.</li>
                                    <li>Before level 20 you can use Hoardapult to chaise enemy heroes or escape. Don't do that after you take Secret Stash.</li>
                                    <li>After you take Secret Stash at level 20, make sure you jump in the middle of team fights and stay in range of your Stash, if the enemies focus you, use all your skills on cooldown (try to find a good angle for Hogg Wild that will keep you in the fight close to your Stash for extra 40 armor), every time a Dynamite explodes you are being healed for 8% of your health INSTANTLY, allowing you to tank the enemy team for as long as your Stash is active while doing crazy amounts of damage.

                                Best Junkrat build in ARAM. Your endless damage potential unlocks at level 20 in teamfights where you can spam Frag Launcher until the enemy team dies, no cooldown. The only time you shouldn't be playing this build is when the enemy team has multiple dashers such as Genji, Graymane, Artanis, etc. and you don't have CC on demand on your team such as Brightwing or Uther, and your team has a lot of damage dealers already.

                                    <li>Don't bother focusing on stacking Taste For Explosions as much in the early game, you'll have plenty of chances to do that after you take Endless Nades and Cannonball! at level 16 and 20 respectively.</li>
                                    <li>If the enemy team has no CC to trigger your Dirty Trickster then take Sticky Wicket.</li>
                                    <li>If it's a no-healer game take Rocket Ride at level 10 instead of RIP-Tire.</li>

                                    <li>Do not take <ta>valla,10,1</ta> as Heroic since it does very little for this build and prevents you from doing auto-attacks which are your main source of damage.</li>

                                    <li>The main source of your damage are going to be your minions, don't put yourself in disadvantageous positions just to auto-attack and risk getting killed. That's why I don't recommend taking <ta>zagara,4,3</ta> because it forces you to be aggressive and Zagara's relatively low HP and no escape abilities means she folds like a newspaper.</li>
                                    <li><ta>zagara,10,2</ta> gives you health and mana regen (if you play Zagara right you'll be OOMing quite frequently) on demand which is great, but most importantly it passively reduces your basic ability cooldowns when you auto-attack while standing on <ab>zagara,5</ab>!</li>
                                    <li>After you get <ta>zagara,16,1</ta> at level 16, spam <ab>zagara,2</ab> on cooldown, do not wait for oppertunity, cast it non-stop. When Roachlings drop if there's an enemy hero in their auto-attack range they will prioratize hitting them.</li>
                                    <li>If the match looks stuck and neither team can push cores, at level 20 consider switching <ta>zagara,20,4</ta> for <ta>zagara,20,2</ta> so you can backdoor if an opportunity arises.</li>
                                    <li>Your worst enemies will be the ones that spawn extra minions, creating extra targets for your own, or the ones that can AOE your Roachlings quickly, e.g. <he>azmodan</he>, <he>zagara</he>, <he>xul</he>, etc.</li>

Keep your health around the 50% mark in order to get 2 stacks per auto-attack, thanks to <ta>zuljin,1,2</ta>. Avoid using <ab>zuljin,6</ab> unless there's a CCed enemy hero and you're not in danger of getting hit by anything.</li>
                                    <li>If the enemy team has multiple roots from heroes like <he>malfurion</he> or <he>kelthuzad</he>, consider getting <ta>zuljin,4,2</ta> instead of <ta>zuljin,4,1</ta>. If you do that, then also take <ta>zuljin,20,1</ta> at level 20 instead of <ta>zuljin,20,3</ta>.</li>
                                    <li>If your team is lacking CC, consider taking <ta>zuljin,13,3</ta> at level 13 instead of <ta>zuljin,13,1</ta>.</li>

                                This is a very situational build, but one that could make all the difference. Only take this build if the enemy team has many high-health heroes (e.g. 2 tanks and a bruiser) and your team doesn't have % damage already (e.g. <he>tychus</he>'s <ab>tychus,5</ab> or <he>zagara</he>'s <ta>zagara,16,1</ta>).
